### Challenges for Efficiently Creating and Maintaining Knowledge Graphs
_Presenter_: <a href="">Prof. Dr. Maria-Esther Vidal</a>

_Abstract_: Knowledge graphs (KGs) have gained momentum as expressive data structures to represent the convergence of data and knowledge spread across various data sources. Albeit coined by the research community for several decades, KGs play an increasingly relevant role in scientific and industrial areas. In particular, the rich amount of data existing in encyclopedic KGs like DBpedia and Wikidata, or domain-specific KGs (e.g., Bio2RDF) demonstrate the feasibility of integrating factual domain-specific knowledge following the Linked Data principles.
Data integrated into existing KGs are collected in heterogeneous formats or physically distributed over multiple data sources. The declarative definition of KGs using W3C recommended languages like R2RML and RML have gained momentum to provide transparent, maintainable, and traceable processes of KG creation. Nevertheless, KG creation is laborious, and various parameters like number and type of mapping assertions and data source complexities like large volume, variety, and high duplicate rates may considerably affect the performance of KG creation. Thus, the process of KG creation demands specialized data management techniques to scale the process of KG creation up.
In this tutorial, we present the challenges faced at data integration and knowledge engineering levels to empower the pipelines of KG creation. We will explain the role of knowledge extraction, mapping languages, integrity constraints, and provenance. We will further discuss techniques for planning and transforming heterogeneous data into RDF KGs following declarative mapping assertions specified in R2RML and RML. Given a set of mapping assertions, the planner provides an optimized execution plan by partitioning and scheduling the execution of the mapping assertions. Moreover, at the execution level,  we will discuss the role of physical operators in efficiently performing the optimized execution plans. The impact of these techniques will be addressed on state-of-the-art engines for RDF KG creation and existing benchmarks. Lastly, we will present strategies for efficiently validating integrity constraints over KGs specified using the W3C recommended language SHACL.
As a result, at the end of the tutorial, the attendees will put in perspective the benefits of planning the execution of pipelines for KG creation and validation, and the role of data management for efficiently constructing and assessing the quality of KGs.

### Application talk 2: Addressing Gartner's challenges for Knowledge Graph implementatio
_Presenter_: <a href="">Silver Oliver</a> 

_Abstract_: Gatner's Hype Cycle for Artificial Intelligence paper identifies 4 obstacles for knowledge graph implementation. In this talk we will take a practical look at addressing these obstacles drawing upon real world case studies.

_Bio_: Silver is an Information Architect who has been working on knowledge graph implementations for the last 15 years. He is a trained Information Professional who focus is on ontology development and implementation. Previously head of Information Architecture at the BBC Silver has worked for Data Language for last 10 years covering a breadth of domains.

_Abstract_: 

### Application Talk 3: Managing and Analyzing Legal Knowledge Graphs
_Presenter_: <a href="">María Navas-Loro</a> and <a href="">Erwin Filtz</a>

_Abstract_: There is a strong demand for access to legal information. For instance, the European Union portal EUR-Lex, which publishes legislation, case law, and other documents related to EU law, serves more than two million documents monthly. Nevertheless, the information required by different stakeholders (such as organizations, companies or citizens) is usually distributed through various sources and presented in different formats and languages, turning legal information retrieval into a time-consuming and tedious process. Legal Knowledge Graphs offer a solution to this situation. In this session, we will present several use cases of legal Knowledge Graphs, highlight the main challenges found and analyse the main lacks in the domain and the lessons learnt. We will go through the different phases of the construction of these Knowledge Graphs, from the search for sources of documents and their main impediments to the extraction of information from them to their subsequent transformation into graph elements.

_Bio_: María Navas-Loro is a postdoctoral researcher in the Ontology Engineering Group (Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, Spain). She is specialised in temporal information processing in the legal domain and has collaborated in national and European projects, such as LPSBigger, Lynx or the current NextProcurement. She is currently working on improving the extraction of events from texts in different languages and domains, and her interest covers natural language processing techniques and knowledge representation.
Erwin Filtz has a background in law and information systems and is working as a research scientist for Siemens. His interests are focused on Knowledge Graphs in the legal domain with the goal to increase accessibility to legal information by applying various tools and techniques from various domains. 


### Knowledge Graphs and Deep Learning for Analyzing Legal Documents
_Presenter_: <a href="">Prof. Manolis Koubarakis</a>

_Abstract_: In this talk I will present the platform Nomothesia (legislation.di.uoa.gr/) and its knowledge graph which encodes Greek legislation as linked data. I will also discuss deep learning techniques for named entity recognition and topic classification for Greek legal documents. Finally, I will present
open problems in this exciting research area. 

_Bio_: Manolis Koubarakis is a Professor and Director of Graduate Studies in the Dept. of Informatics and Telecommunications, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. He leads the Artificial Intelligence team (http://ai.di.uoa.gr). He holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science, from the National Technical University of Athens, an M.Sc. in Computer Science, from the University of Toronto, and a diploma (B.Sc.) in Mathematics, from the University of Crete. He is a Fellow of EurAI (European Association for Artificial Intelligence) since 2015 and President of the Hellenic Association for Artificial Intelligence. He is a member of the Advisory Board that implements the Hellenic National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence. He has published more than 200 papers that have been widely cited (7099 citations and h-index 44 in Google Scholar) in the areas of Artificial Intelligence (especially Knowledge Representation), Databases, Semantic Web and Linked Geospatial Data (especially Earth observation data). His research has been financially supported with a total amount exceeding 8 million Euros by the European Commission, the Hellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation, the Greek General Secretariat for Research and Technology, the European Space Agency and industry.

He is currently a visiting researcher at the Jozef Stefan Institute in Slovenia, and at the Information Sciences Institute (ISI)/USC in the USA. He has over 250 publications, H-Index of 41, and 8913 citations (Google Scholar). In the 1990s and early 2000s he was one of the pioneers in the Web Engineering field, and later in Semantic Web technologies and applications.
