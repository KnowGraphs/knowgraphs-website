The third winter school of the KnowGraphs takes place on March 7th–9th, 2023 in Vienna. Each KnowGraphs winter school is dedicated to both domain-based disciplinary training (such as data science, legal or health), and professional and complementary training. The third winter school serves as accelerator for specific sub-disciplines with a more detailed focus on the KnowGraph's Early Stage Researchers research problems.

### Symbolic Background Knowledge for Machine Learning
_Presenter_: <a href="https://knowgraphs.eu/AxelPolleres">Steffen Staab</a> <a href="steffen.staab@ipvs.uni-stuttgart.de">✉</a>

_Abstract_: Machine learning aims at learning complex functions from data. Very often, this challenge remains ill-defined given the available amount of data, however, background knowledge that is available as knowledge graphs, ontologies or symbolic (physical) equations allows for an improved specification of the targeted solution. In this talk, we want to discuss several use cases that include symbolic background knowledge as regularizing priors, as constraints or as other inductive biases into machine learning tasks.

### Multi-perspective Modelling Of Complex Concepts - The Case Of Olfactory History & Heritage
_Presenter_: <a href="https://mariekevanerp.com/">Marieke Van Erp</a> <a href="marieke.van.erp@dh.huc.knaw.nl">✉</a>

_Abstract_: The success of AI technologies on standardised benchmark datasets, invites us to move towards more difficult and more complex concepts and tasks. In this talk, I will argue that the humanities  presents the perfect playground for investigating the recognition and modelling of complex concepts thanks to massive digitisation efforts that have made available large and varied datasets, in multiple modalities, in this domain. Specifically, I will highlight the complexities in modelling a concept such as smell, dealing with its representations in various media, and how the temporal dimension of historical and linguistic research forces us to deal with issues such as changing social norms and our colonial history. This will show the exciting possibilities of what we term Cultural AI.

### Explaining and Repairing Description Logic Ontologies
_Presenter_: <a href="https://iccl.inf.tu-dresden.de/web/Franz_Baader">Franz Baader</a> <a href="franz.baader@tu-dresden.de">✉</a>

_Abstract_: Description Logics (DLs) are a prominent family of logic-based knowledge representation formalisms, which offer a good compromise between expressiveness and the complexity of reasoning and are the formal basis for the Web ontology language OWL. Like all large human-made digital artefacts, ontologies may contain errors, and this problem gets even worse if parts of the ontology are automatically generated by inexact methods based on information retrieval or machine learning. Errors are often detected when reasoning finds an inconsistency or generates unintuitive consequences. It is then important for the ontology engineer to understand why such an unwanted consequence follows from the ontology, and to use this understanding to repair the ontology appropriately.<br/>
The classical approach for addressing this problem is to compute so-called justifications, i.e., minimal subsets of the ontology from which the consequence already follows. Since justifications are often much smaller  than the whole ontology, the idea is then that it should be easy to see why the unwanted consequence follows from the justification. Using Reiter’s hitting set duality, one can also use justifications to compute classical repairs, i.e. maximal subsets of the ontology that do not have the unwanted consequence. However, this classical approach does not always work well in practice. Regarding understandability, justification may sometimes still be quite large, and even for fairly small justification, the reasoning needed to derive the consequence can get involved. Classical repairs are subsets of the given ontology, which makes this approach syntax-dependent, and such a repair may remove more consequences than necessary.<br/>
In the talk, I will first review the classical approach for ontology understanding and repair. Then, I will, on the one hand, describe our recent work on explaining DL reasoning using proofs in an appropriate calculus, as well as our interactive proof visualisations tool. On the other hand, I will given an overview of our results on computing optimal repairs for DL-based ontologies, where optimality means that a maximal amount of consequences (rather than just a maximal subset of the ontology) it preserved.

### Hybrid Intelligence
_Presenter_: <a href="https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/ilaria-tiddi">Ilaria Tiddi</a> <a href="i.tiddi@vu.nl">✉</a>

_Abstract_: Hybrid Intelligence is an emerging field of research that combines human and artificial intelligent systems to create a more collaborative, interactive, and holistic notion of intelligence. In Hybrid Intelligence, the emphasis is on adaptive, collaborative, responsible, interactive and human-centered intelligent systems, that assist us, leverage our strengths and compensate for human weaknesses.  This new field of study is being driven by rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), but it fundamentally necessitates collaboration and interaction with many other fields investigating human-AI interactions. In this talk, I will present the Hybrid Intelligence, its vision, current developments and challenges for future directions.

### Scientific Event Management: Being Active in your Community
_Presenter_: <a href="https://nm.wu.ac.at/nm/en:kirrane">Sabrina Kirrane</a> <a href="sabrina.kirrane@wu.ac.at">✉</a>

_Abstract_: Early stage researchers spend a lot of time learning how to conduct research and fine tuning their academic writing skills. Researchers are often under pressure to publish their research findings in highly ranked and very competitive conferences and journals. However, who are the people behind these conferences and journals and why are some more competitive than others? In this talk, we will go behind the scenes in order to better understand: How conferences and journals function? What are the various roles and responsibilities? What does it mean to be part of a community? Why do so many people willing engage in unpaid community service? What steps can you take in order to become more active in your community?

### Knowledge Graphs and Information Retrieval
_Presenter_: <a href="https://www.ics.forth.gr/~tzitzik">Yannis Tzitzikas</a> <a href="tzitzik@ics.forth.gr">✉</a>

_Abstract_: Since the task of accessing Knowledge Graphs through structured query languages, like SPARQL, is rather demanding for ordinary users, there are various approaches that attempt to exploit the simpler and widely used keyword-based search paradigm. However, this task is challenging since there is no clear unit of retrieval and presentation, the user information needs are in most cases not clearly formulated, the underlying RDF datasets are in most cases incomplete, and there is not a single presentation method appropriate for all kinds of information needs.  As a means to alleviate these problems, in this talk we will focus on how we can leverage the arsenal of techniques and systems from the area of Information Retrieval (IR) for offering IR services over Knowledge Graphs. Subsequently, we shall focus on an interactive approach for searching Knowledge Graphs that offers multiple presentation methods (perspectives) of the search results, allowing the user to easily switch between these perspectives and thus exploit the benefit that each such perspective offers.  Finally, we shall show how keyword search can also benefit other tasks, like Question Answering, and we will showcase various related research prototypes.

### Making Natural Language Understanding interpretable with Knowledge Graphs
_Presenter_: <a href="https://www.diag.uniroma1.it/navigli/">Roberto Navigli</a> <a href="navigli@diag.uniroma1.it">✉</a>

_Abstract_: The advent of deep learning has revolutionized the way Natural Language Processing is performed, especially thanks to its success in carrying out all kinds of tasks that involve natural language, ranging from part-of-speech tagging to text generation and summarization. However, if we scratch beyond the surface level of fluent sequences of tokens, it is hard to ensure that mainstream Transformer-based architectures base their output on consistent semantics. In this talk I will present different approaches that exploit Knowledge Graphs with the goal of making Natural Language Understanding tasks more interpretable by humans, therefore going in the direction of connecting text to explicit meaning and, vice versa, using meaning to improve the way natural language is processed.
