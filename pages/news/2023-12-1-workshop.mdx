# Completion of the KnowGraphs workshop in Vienna

The 7th KnowGraphs workshop for the ESRs of the project took place in Vienna, from 30 November 2023 to 1 December 2023. The workshop was hosted by the Vienna University of Economics and Business (WU), and organised by the Assistant Professor Sabrina Kirrane, as well as the ESR of our project, In√®s Akaichi.

In the first day of the project, the ESRs of our team worked on a Hackathon. The purpose of the activity was the development of a knowledge graph-based application that brings together the academic research of all the ESRs. The second day of the workshop was dedicated to networking activities, in which the ESRs were given the chance to come together and discuss future collaborations. The second day also included an escape-room challenge and a city tour in the city of Vienna.
