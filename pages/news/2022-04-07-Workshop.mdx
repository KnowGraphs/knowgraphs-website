# KnowGraphs Workshop Organised by Vienna University of Economics and Business

 For two days on April 7th and 8th, the 4th KnowGraphs workshop took place at WU, Vienna University of Economics and Business. Thirteen ESRs from seven different partners attended the workshop in person, following the Covid regulations in Vienna and WU, while two ESRs as well as the supervisors and mentors of the project participated in the workshop virtually.

The first half of the first day of the workshop focused on the progress that ESRs have made in their respective research topics. Each ESR gave a short presentation focusing on their research work and their accomplishments within the scope of the project. The second half of the day was dedicated to an open discussion among ESRs and the guest talk from Dr. Georgia Panteli, with the title, 'Making Your Research Known.' On the second day, guest speaker Saara Inkinen gave her talks on improving research impact and creating new opportunities with technology/knowledge transfer. The last session of the second was a team-building activity among ESRs.
