# Presentation of the GDPR-CARPA certificate
## Efstratios Koulierakis - ESR 15, University of Groningen

According to the regime established in accordance with articles 42-43 GDPR, data protection certification is a process in which a certifying party attests that particular processing operations comply with the Regulation. The GDPR-CARPA is the first data protection certificate officially approved by a Data Protection Authority. Specifically, the scheme was approved by CNPD, the data protection authority of Luxembourg. The scheme is a general one and it is applicable to all kinds of data processing operations. GDPR-CARPA prescribes methods of compliance with the GDPR and it goes beyond what is strictly required by the Regulation.
