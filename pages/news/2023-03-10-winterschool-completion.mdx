# Winter School 2023

The 2023 Knowledge Graphs Winter School in Vienna was successfully completed. The winter school was organised by the Vienna University of Economics and Business (Wirtschaftsuniversit√§t Wien). The KnowGraphs workshops were attended by the ESRs of the research consortium as well as PhD researchers from multiple institutions. During the winter school, the participants had the opportunity to attend lectures on knowledge graphs, artificial intelligence and semantic web technologies. Moreover, the participants participated in a hands on activity where they were asked to develop their own knowledge graphs. In the end of the winter school, the participants presented the results of their work. The full programme of the winter school, as well as information about the speakers are available [here](/ws2023/).
